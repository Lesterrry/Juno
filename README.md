 ## Saving the disk
 1. Insert the disk and launch Juno
 2. Go to *./Music/Juno/Disks*
 3. Find an image for the disk. It must be 1x1 and not bigger than 1000x1000px
 4. Move it in this folder and make up an easy name for it
 5. Look for a JSON file which represents your disk
 6. Fill in all the properties using this template:
 ```
 {
   "tracks": [
     {
       "title": "FIRST TRACK TITLE",
       "album": "FIRST TRACK ALBUM",
       "url": "URL; DO NOT CHANGE",
       "artist": "FIRST TRACK ARTIST"
     },
     {
       "title": "SECOND TRACK TITLE",
       "album": "SECOND TRACK ALBUM",
       "url": "URL; DO NOT CHANGE",
       "artist": "SECOND TRACK ARTIST"
     },
     {
       "title": "THIRD TRACK TITLE",

       "url": "URL; DO NOT CHANGE",
       "artist": "THIRD TRACK ARTIST"
     }
   ],
   "reliable": true IF THIS FILE SHOULD BE USED; false IF IT SHOULD NOT, 
   "title": "DISK TITLE",
   "cover_image_name": "NAME OF IMAGE WITH AN EXTENSION"
 }
 ```
